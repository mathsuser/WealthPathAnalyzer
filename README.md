# WealthPathAnalyzer

WealthPathAnalyzer is a Python-based toolkit for analyzing, visualizing, and backtesting investment strategies across core asset classes (stocks, bonds, gold, crypto, and cash). Designed for both learning and research, it provides robust data pipelines, return calculations, and clear wealth path visualizations.

**Goal:**
- Help users understand and compare the growth of $1 invested in different assets, with and without reinvestment, over time.

**Current Features:**
- Clean, well-documented data for major asset classes
- Modular Python code for return and wealth path calculations
- Flexible backtesting engine for single-asset strategies
- Ready-to-use plotting utilities for wealth path visualization

**Upcoming:**
- Simpler, focused case study notebooks (impact of inflation, diversification benefits, risk-adjusted returns, portfolio construction)
- More example strategies and scenario analysis
- Enhanced documentation and user guides

Motivated by personal curiosity about wealth creation and quantitative investing.
